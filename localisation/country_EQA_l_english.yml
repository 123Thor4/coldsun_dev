prance.1.t:0 "La Fleur Solitaire"
prance.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Prance is a nation founded in the year 1060, under the reign of King Amareux-Esprit, who was crowned \"King of Prance\" in Hayris.\nPrance has always remained a relatively strong and potent nation during its existence, and quickly became a hotspot for wonders until the most recent centuries, where it was ousted by the Equestrian Monarchy. Historical achievements of Prance include but aren't limited to the Naponylic Empire, who reached from Hondeaux all the way to Lercetar, and the tip of Marthe-et-Frantal to the Yaks' lands, and the Declaration of the Rights of the Citizen.\n\nIn the most recent centuries however, Prance suffered defeats against outside forces, most notably the Thestrykan Thestral Empire, who took over the Marthe-et-Frantal province to the north in 1831, and was then surpassed by most regional powers during the next century. The military quickly became incompetent, but mostly corrupt, with no real values, though there are still competent generals remaining in the army, but they were still no match when they tried to intervene in Ercenbrand's revolution.\n\nDespite all these hardships, Prance still remains a regional power, boasting a sizeable army, navy and airforce, along with a capable industrial base, but the recent political turmoils about the corrupt bureaucracy has destabilized the nation severely."
prance.1.a:0 "Nous voilà. What a dire situation we're in."
prance.1.b:0 "Explain Prance's situation to me."
prance.2.t:0 "The Prench Dilemma"
prance.2.d:0 "The Prench Army is in majority made of officers with ties to the nobility, and are unsurprisingly mostly incompetent, and very few competent officers occupy these ranks.\n\nDespite this, some officers still look beyond that and has in mind even more ambitious projects, including an overthrow of the King and the establishment of a Military Junta or Dictatorship.\n\nPrance also stands in the middle of two, even three major powers, and must choose a side to be able to survive the inevitable onslaught, and the most obvious options that the King and Nobility are routing for is staying alongside Equestria, whom Prance shares a long history with.\n\nThough some more optimistic ponies in the government have opted to become a neutral, buffer zone between these three nations."
prance.2.a:0 "May Prance last for eternity."
prance.4500.t:0 "La Flamme de la Résistance"
prance.4500.d:0 "\"My fellow Prench camarades, the leaders and generals of Prance has evacuated the Capital, and has left what remains of the Prench forces behind, along with their citizens. It has claimed that the army was defeated, and retreated back behind Equestrian lines for their own safety.\n\nBut what about us? What twisted fate does the Ercenbrander has for us? Whatever it may be, we will not stand idly, waiting for our inevitable doom! Because has the last word been said? Should we give up hope? Is the defeat definitive? No! Nothing is lost for Prance, while they are fighting in the front, we must strike at their backs!\n\nIt's because Prance is not alone! This war is not limited to the unfortunate territory of our own country! This war will definitely not be decided by the battle of Prance. This is a world war. All the errors, all the delays, all the suffering cannot change the fact that there are, in this universe, all the means necessary to one day crush our enemies.\n\nI, Vaillante Mercure, call upon all the remaining Prench officers and soldiers, with or without their weapons, to rise up against the invaders! Upon all the engineers and workers, to contact our brave warriors and design, manufacture new weapons for them!\n\nWhatever happens, the flame of Prench Resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished!\""
